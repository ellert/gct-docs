<h1><?php echo $title; ?></h1>

<p>Globus Toolkit components (GridFTP, etc) are configured by default to send
  out UDP packets logging their activity. We have written a simple receiver which
  listens for these packets and records them to a database. This receiver is
  not included as part of the Globus Toolkit 4 distribution, but is available
  from Globus via anonymous CVS. This document describes how to install and run
  the receiver on a host of your choice, should you wish to record usage statistics.</p>

<h2><a name="prereq"></a>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>An SQL database installation.</b> SQL batch files are included for PostgreSQL
    and MySQL. Other databases may require slight modifications to these files;
    check your database documentation. You will also need a JDBC (Java DataBase
    Connection) .jar file for your database; most database vendors make these
    available on their websites.</li>
  <li><b>The Globus Toolkit 4.</b> Only the Java WS Core component is needed,
    so you can get away with just installing that if you don't want to do the
    full installation on the host which will be listening. See the main Globus
    install documentation. After installation, make sure that the environment
    variable GLOBUS_LOCATION is set to the directory where globus is installed.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="getting_code"></a>Getting the code</h2>
<pre>cd $GLOBUS_LOCATION
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.globus.org:/home/globdev/CVS/globus-packages co usage/java
</pre>
<h2><a name="install"></a>Installation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>First edit the <b>receiver.properties</b> file. This is located at
      <pre>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/usage/java/receiver/samples/etc/receiver.properties
</pre>
    The fields you must change are <b>database-driver</b> and <b>database-url</b>. <b>database-driver</b> should
    be set to the class name of the JDBC driver for your database: for example, "org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver" for
    MySQL or "org.postgresql.Driver" for PostgreSQL. See your database documentation. <b>database-url</b> should
    be set to the location where your database server is running. It should be
    of the form
    <pre>jdbc:vendor://host:port/database?user=username?password=passwd
</pre>
    See your database vendor's documentation for more information. Note that
    the password will be sent in cleartext, so don't use an important one.</li>
  <li>Make sure that your jdbc .jar file is in a location where globus can find
    it: copy it into $GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib/. </li>
  <li>Create a database called <b>guss</b> on your database server to store the
    usage data. The syntax for creating a database is vendor-specific.</li>
  <li>Finally, to create tables with the correct schema within the <b>guss</b> database,
    run one of the SQL batch files. These are in
      <pre>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/usage/java/receiver/samples/etc/
  </pre>
    There is an SQL batch file for PostgreSQL and one for MySQL. Other databases
    may differs slightly in their syntax for creating tables, so you may need
    to modify one of these files.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="compile"></a>Compiling and running the receiver</h2>
<pre>cd $GLOBUS_LOCATION/usage/java
ant
</pre>
<p>Finally, to start the receiver, type:</p>
<pre>ant receiver
</pre>
<p>The receiver will now start up (blocking the terminal) and begin listening
  on the port specified in receiver.properties (4810 by default). It will record
  to the database all the usage packets that it receives.</p>
<p>Remember, the Globus Toolkit components you are interested in must be configured
  to send their usage packets to the host where the receiver is running. A component
  can be configured to send usage packets to multiple hosts simply by listing
  all of the hostnames, separated by spaces, on one line of the appropriate properties
  file. For more information, see the documentation for the individual components.</p>
