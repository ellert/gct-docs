==== Some tools to validate certificate setup ====


===== grid-cert-diagnostics =====

The
link:../..gsic/user/index.html#grid-cert-diagnostics[**++grid-cert-diagnostics++**]
program checks prints diagnostics about the user's certificates, and
host security environment. 

--------
%  grid-cert-diagnostics -p
--------



===== Check that the user certificate is valid =====



--------
openssl verify -CApath /etc/grid-security/certificates
  -purpose sslclient ~/.globus/usercert.pem
--------


===== Connect to the server using s_client =====



--------
openssl s_client -ssl3 -cert ~/.globus/usercert.pem -key 
  ~/.globus/userkey.pem -CApath /etc/grid-security/certificates 
  -connect <host:port>
--------

Here '<host:port>' denotes the server and port you connect to.

If it prints an error and puts you back at the command prompt, then it
typically means that the **server** has closed the connection, i.e. that
the server was not happy with the client's certificate and verification.
Check the SSL log on the server.

If the command "hangs" then it has actually opened a telnet style (but
secure) socket, and you can "talk" to the server.

You should be able to scroll up and see the subject names of the
server's verification chain:



--------

depth=2 /DC=net/DC=ES/O=ESnet/OU=Certificate Authorities/CN=ESnet Root CA 1
verify return:1
depth=1 /DC=org/DC=DOEGrids/OU=Certificate Authorities/CN=DOEGrids CA 1
verify return:1
depth=0 /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=wiggum.mcs.anl.gov
verify return:1
    
--------

In this case, there were no errors. Errors would give you an extra line
next to the subject name of the certificate that caused the error.


===== Check that the server certificate is valid =====

Requires root login on server:



--------

    openssl verify -CApath /etc/grid-security/certificates -purpose sslserver 
     /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
--------
