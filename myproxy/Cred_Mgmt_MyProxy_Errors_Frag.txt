  <entry><code> MyProxy server name does not match expected name</code></entry>
  <entry><simpara>This error appears as a mutual authentication failure or a server authentication failure, and the error message should list two names: 
   the expected name of the MyProxy server and the actual authenticated name.</simpara> 
   <simpara>By default, the MyProxy clients expect the MyProxy server to be running with a host certificate that matches the target hostname. 
   This error can occur when running the MyProxy server under a non-host certificate or if the server is running on a machine with multiple hostnames.</simpara> The MyProxy clients authenticate the identity of the MyProxy server to avoid sending passphrases and credentials to rogue servers.
  <simpara> If the expected name contains an IP address, your system is unable to do a reverse lookup on that address to get the canonical hostname of the server, indicating either a problem with that machine's DNS record or a problem with the resolver on your system.</simpara></entry>
  <entry>
If the server name shown in the error message is acceptable, set the <envar>MYPROXY_SERVER_DN</envar> environment variable to that name to resolve the problem.
  </entry>
</row>
 <row>
  <entry><code>Error in bind(): Address already in use</code></entry>
  <entry>This error indicates that the myproxy-server port (default: 7512) is in use by another process, probably another myproxy-server 
   instance. You cannot run multiple instances of the myproxy-server on the same network port.</entry>
  <entry>
If you want to run multiple instances of the myproxy-server on a machine, you can specify different ports with the <option>-p</option> option, 
   and then give the same <option>-p</option> option to the MyProxy commands to tell them to use the myproxy-server on that port.
  </entry>

 <row>
  <entry><code>grid-proxy-init failed</code></entry>
  <entry>This error indicates that the grid-proxy-init command failed when myproxy-init attempted to run it, which implies a problem with the 
   underlying Globus installation.</entry>
  <entry>
Run <screen>grid-proxy-init -debug -verify</screen> for more information. 
  </entry>
 </row>
 <row>
  <entry><code>User not authorized</code></entry>
  <entry>An error from the myproxy-server saying you are "not authorized" to complete an operation typically indicates that the 
   <filename>myproxy-server.config</filename> file settings are restricting your access to the myproxy-server. It is possible that the 
   myproxy-server is running with the default <filename>myproxy-server.config</filename> file, which does not authorize any operations.</entry>

 <row>
  <entry><code>Unable to verify remote side's credentials</code></entry>
  <entry>
    An error saying "Unable to verify remote side's credentials,"
    "Couldn't verify the remote certificate," or "alert bad certificate"
    often indicates that the client or server's certificate is signed by
    an untrusted Certification Authority (CA). The client must have a CA
    certificate and signing policy file installed in
    <filename>/etc/grid-security/certificates</filename> for the CA that signed the server's
    certificate. Likewise, the server must have a CA certificate and
    signing policy file installed in <filename>/etc/grid-security/certificates</filename> for
    the CA that signed the client's certificate.
