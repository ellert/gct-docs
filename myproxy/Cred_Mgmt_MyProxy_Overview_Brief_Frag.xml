MyProxy is open source software for managing X.509 Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) security credentials (certificates and private
keys). MyProxy combines an online credential repository with an online
certificate authority to allow users to securely obtain credentials
when and where needed. Users run <command>myproxy-logon</command> to
authenticate and obtain credentials, including trusted CA certificates
and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
