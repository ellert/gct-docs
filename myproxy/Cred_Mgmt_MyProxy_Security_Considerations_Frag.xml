<para>
You should choose a well-protected host to run the myproxy-server
on. Consult with security-aware personnel at your site. You want a host
that is secured to the level of a Kerberos KDC, that has limited user
access, runs limited services, and is well monitored and maintained in
terms of security patches.

<para>
For a typical myproxy-server installation, 
the host on which the myproxy-server is running must
    have /etc/grid-security created and a <glossterm>host certificate</glossterm> installed.
In this case, the myproxy-server will run as root so it can access the
host certificate and key.
