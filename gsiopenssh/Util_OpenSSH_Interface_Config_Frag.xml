<chapter id="gsiopenssh-configuring"><title>Configuring</title>
<para>
  The GSI-enabled OpenSSH software is installed with a default set of
  configuration files, described below.
  You may want to modify the <filename>ssh_config</filename> file before using the
  clients and the <filename>sshd_config</filename> file before using the server.
</para>
<para>
    If the GSI-enabled OpenSSH install script finds existing SSH key
    pairs, it will create symbolic links to them rather than
    generating new key pairs.  The SSH key pairs are not required for
    GSI authentication.  However, if you wish to support other SSH
    authentication methods, make sure the sshd (running as root) can
    read the key pair files (i.e., beware of NFS mounts with
    root_squash).  If running multiple sshds on a system, we recommend
    configuring them so they all use the same key pairs (i.e., use
    symbolic links) to avoid client-side confusion.
