<para>
This is a guide for using the GSI-enabled OpenSSH client. It assumes
that you (or your system administrator) 
have already
installed the GSI OpenSSH
and that you have also
  acquired a <glossterm>user certificate</glossterm> from an appropriate <glossterm>Certificate Authority</glossterm>.

  <section id="gsiopenssh-user-create-proxy">
  <title>Creating a proxy</title>
    <para>
      First, set the GLOBUS_LOCATION environment variable to the location of your
      GSI-enabled OpenSSH installation.
      It may already be set for you by your system administrator.</para>
    <para>
      Then, create a <glossterm baseform="proxy credentials">proxy credential</glossterm> for GSI authentication by running the
      <command>grid-proxy-init</command> program.
      This is your single sign-on to the Grid.
      By default, <command>grid-proxy-init</command> will create a proxy
      credential good for 12 hours. </para>
    <para>
      To create a proxy credential with a different lifetime, use the
      <command>-hours</command> option.</para>  
    
    <para>For example:
      <screen>% grid-proxy-init -hours 8</screen>
    </para>
  </section>
  <section id="gsiopenssh-user-delete-proxy">
  <title>Deleting a proxy</title>
    <para>To delete a proxy that was previously create with grid-proxy-init, run:</para>
    
    <screen>% grid-proxy-destroy</screen>
  </section>
  
<section id="gsiopenssh-user-authorization">
  <title>Getting authorized to connect to a site</title>
<para>
Before you can connect to a site, the site needs to know the identity
in your certificate so that it can map that identity to your
local account.  At a minimum, the site will need to know your subject
name from your certificate.  You can get your subject name by running
<command>grid-cert-info</command> with the <command>-subject</command> argument.
For example: 
</para>

<screen>
% grid-cert-info -subject
</screen>

<para>
Email your subject name to the administrator of the system you wish to
connect to so that they can add your entry to the appropriate
authorization files.
</para>

<para>
Once you have your proxy credential, all you should have to do is run
gsissh, providing it with the hostname of the host you want to connect
to.  For example:

<screen>
% gsissh myhost.somedomain.edu
</screen>
You should then find
yourself automatically logged into your account on the remote system.

<section id="gsiopenssh-user-passphrase"><title>The gsissh command
      prompts you for a pass phrase when you run it</title>
    <para>This could mean that you don't have a proxy certificate; try
      running <command>grid-proxy-init</command> and then running gsissh again. It
      could also mean that the GSI authentication is failing for some
      reason and gsissh is falling back to a different authentication
      mechanism. Reasons that it might fail include:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><simpara>The host you are connecting to does not have a GSI-enabled
      OpenSSH server. </simpara></listitem>
      <listitem><simpara>You are not authorized to use GSI authentication to the host. Contact the administrator. </simpara></listitem>
