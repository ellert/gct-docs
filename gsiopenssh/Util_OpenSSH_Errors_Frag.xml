  <entry><code>GSS-API error Failure acquiring GSSAPI credentials: GSS_S_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED</code></entry>
  <entry>This means that your proxy certificate has expired.</entry>

Run <olink targetdoc="gsicPI" targetptr="grid-proxy-init">grid-proxy-init</olink> to acquire a new proxy certificate, then run <code>gsissh</code> again.

  <entry><code>...no proxy credentials...</code></entry>
  <entry>Failing to run grid-proxy-init to create a user proxy with which to connect will result in the client notifying you that no local credentials 
   exist. Any attempt to authenticate using GSI will fail in this case.

  <entry><code>...gssapi received empty username; failed to set username from gssapi context; Failed external-keyx for &lt;user&gt; from &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;...</code></entry>
  <entry>If the server was passed an "implicit username" (i.e. requested to map the incoming connection to a username based on some 
   contextual clues such as the certificate's subject), and no entry exists in the grid-mapfile for the incoming connection's certificate subject, 
   the server should output a clue that states it is unable to set the username against which to authenticate.

  <entry><code>...INTERNAL ERROR: authenticated invalid user xxx...</code></entry>
  <entry>If the subject name given in the system's grid-mapfile points to a non-existent user, the server will give an internal error 
   which is best caught when it is running in debugging mode.

  <entry><code>...gssapi received empty username; no suitable client data; failed to set username from gssapi context; Failed external-keyx for &lt;user&gt; from &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;...</code></entry>
  <entry> Should the user attempt to connect without first creating a proxy certificate, or if the user is connecting via a SSH client that does 
   not support GSI authentication, the server will note that no GSSAPI data was sent to it. Verify that the client is able to connect through 
   another GSI service (such as the gatekeeper) to make sure that the user's proxy has been created correctly.
