<para>
  The Grid Resource Allocation and Management (GRAM5) component
  is used to locate, submit, monitor, and cancel jobs on Grid computing resources. GRAM5 is not a <glossterm>Local Resource Manager</glossterm>,
  but rather a set of services and clients for communicating with a range of
  different batch/cluster job schedulers using a common protocol. GRAM5 is
  meant to address a range of jobs where reliable operation, stateful
  monitoring, credential management, and file staging are important.
