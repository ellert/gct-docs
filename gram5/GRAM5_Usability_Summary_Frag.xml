    <simpara>Fault Tolerance.  The ability for the GRAM service to recover after a container or host crash.  Recovery includes the continued processing and monitoring of all jobs managed by the GRAM service at the time of the crash.  The <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable> GRAM architecture was simplified (from GT3) which is the main reason that fault tolerance has improved.</simpara>
