<title>Gatekeeper Security Considerations</title>
<para>
&GRAM; runs different parts of itself under different privilege
levels. The &gatekeeper; runs as root, and uses its root privilege to access
the host's private key. It uses the <glossterm>grid map file</glossterm> to
map <glossterm baseform="certificate">Grid Certificates</glossterm> to
local user ids and then uses the <function>setuid()</function> function
to change to that user and execute the &jobmanager; program
</para>

<section>
<title>Job Manager Security Considerations</title>
<para>
The  &jobmanager; program runs as a local non-root account. It receives
a delegated limited <glossterm>proxy certificate</glossterm> from the &GRAM;
client which it uses to access Grid storage resources via GridFTP and to
authenticate job signals (such as client cancel requests), and send
job state callbacks to registered clients. This proxy is generally short-lived,
and is automatically removed by the job manager when the job completes.
</para>

<para>
The &jobmanager; program uses a publicly-writable directory for job state
files. This directory has the <emphasis>sticky</emphasis> bit set, so 
users may not remove other users files. Each file is named by a UUID, so
it should be unique.
</para>

<title>Fork SEG Module Security Considerations</title>

<para>
The Fork Scheduler Event Generator module uses a globally writable file
for job state change events. This is not recommended for production use.
