    <title>Experiment Hardware and Software Configuration</title>

    <para>
    The following experiments were run on the
    <systemitem class="systemname">nomer.mcs.anl.gov</systemitem> virtual
    cluster. The
    cluster consists of 6 partitions, each having a single
    <hardware>Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5430 @ 2.66GHz</hardware> core, and 2GB
    RAM. The virtual machines in the cluster each had a single virtual network
    interface. The cluster was configured as follows:

    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><simpara>1 node: Master node</simpara></listitem>
        <listitem><simpara>5 nodes: Test/execution nodes</simpara></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
    All nodes ran an <command>apache2</command> http server,
    <command>gmond</command> (ganglia monitoring), and
    <command>pbs_mom</command> (torque LRM).
    </para>

    <para>
        The master node also ran a <command>globus-gatekeeper</command>,
        <command>globus-gridftp-server</command>,
        <command>globus-job-manager-event-generator</command>,
        <command>gmetad</command> (Ganglia Meta Daemon),
        <command>pbs_sched</command> (Torque LRM scheduler),
        <command>pbs_server</command> (Torque LRM server), and
        <command>nfsd</command> linux kernel NFSv4 server for the execution
        nodes.
    </para>

    <para>
        The test nodes (1 for single-client tests, 5 for
        multiple client tests) ran the
        <command>gram-throughput-tester</command> program. All 5 test/execution
        nodes executed the test job executables as scheduled by the LRM.
    </para>

    <para>
        These tests were done with GT 5.0.2 beta1. The throughput tester was
        compiled from CVS trunk October 30, 2009.

    <title>Experiment Scenarios</title>

    <para>
        The first set of tests submitted jobs to the GRAM5 service for one hour.
        After one hour elapsed, the client would terminate any jobs which were
        being managed by the GRAM5 service. The test client recorded the time
        of the experiment start, the time of the termination start, and the
        time after which all jobs had reached a DONE or FAILED state.
    </para>

    <para>
        The throughput test client would generate a maximum of 50 simultaneous
        job requests. For all but the <emphasis>uncapped</emphasis> test below,
        a maximum of 2000 jobs were managed by the job manager at any given
        time (pending or active). Once the client had submitted 2000 jobs, it
        would stop submissions until a job completed. A total of 10 execution
        slots were available for the LRM to schedule jobs into, so many were in
        the GRAM5 PENDING state during the duration of the test.
    </para>

        The different <command>gram-throughput-tester</command> experiments
        consisted of:
