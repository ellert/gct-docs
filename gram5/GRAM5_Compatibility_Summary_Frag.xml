  <listitem>
  <simpara>The GRAM5 service uses a superset of the GRAM2 protocol for 
  communciation between the client and service. The extensions supported
  in GRAM5 are implemented in such a way that they are ignored by GRAM2
  services or clients. These extensions provide improved error messages and
  version detection.

  <listitem>
  <simpara>GRAM5 does not support task coallocation using DUROC and its related
  protocols. Jobs submitted using DUROC directives will fail.
  </simpara>

  <listitem>
  <simpara>GRAM5 does not support file streaming. The standard output and
  standard error streams are sent after the job completes instead of during
  execution. As a special case, support for the Condor grid monitor program
  implements a small subset of the streaming capabilities of GRAM2 in GT 4.2.x.
