    <title>Overview</title>
    <para> SoftEnv is a system designed to make it easier for users to define what applications they
      want to use, and easier for administrators to make applications available to users. SoftEnv
      has evolved from the original implementation called Soft designed at Northeastern University
      in 1994. </para>
    <para> In some environments, like TeraGrid, it is desirable to make use of SoftEnv before a job
      is submitted to leverage the use of an exactly defined software environment in which the job
      will run. </para>

    <title>Configuring SoftEnv Support</title>
    <para> Because this feature is very specific and may not be available on many systems, support
      for SoftEnv is disabled by default in normal job submissions. There is a parameter in the JNDI
      configuration of GRAM5 to enable SoftEnv support in job submissions. </para>
    <para> SoftEnv support must be enabled on a per-scheduler basis because the internal mechanisms
      to support SoftEnv vary between the different types of schedulers. Currently only the Fork,
      PBS and LSF schedulers can be configured to have SoftEnv support enabled (Condor is not yet
      supported). </para>
    <para>To enable this feature, set the parameter <parameter
      >enableDefaultSoftwareEnvironment</parameter> in the scheduler specific JNDI configuration to
        <computeroutput>true</computeroutput>. </para>
    <para>For example, to enable SoftEnv support in the Fork scheduler, set the <parameter
        >enableDefaultSoftwareEnvironment</parameter> in <filename
        >$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_gram_Fork/jndi-config.xml</filename> to <computeroutput
      >true</computeroutput>. </para>
    <para> Enabled SoftEnv support means that a user's default environment will be created from his
        <computeroutput>.soft</computeroutput> file before each job submission automatically. The
      user does not need to provide extra SoftEnv keys in the extensions element of a job
      description. This is not done if the SoftEnv feature is disabled. </para>
    <para> For more information and examples, please look in the <olink targetdoc="gram5User"
        targetptr="gram5-user-softenv">SoftEnv section of the User's Guide</olink>. </para>

    <title>Dependencies</title>
    <para> For the scheduler, Fork SoftEnv needs to be installed on the host in which the container
      is running. </para>
    <para>For PBS and LSF, SoftEnv needs to be installed on the hosts where the jobs are executed.
