The Globus Toolkit GSI C component provides APIs and tools for authentication,
authorization and certificate management. The authentication API is built using
<glossterm baseform="public key">Public Key</glossterm> Infrastructure (PKI)
technologies, e.g. X.509 Certificates and TLS. In addition to authentication it
features a delegation mechanism based upon X.509 <glossterm baseform="proxy
certificate">Proxy Certificates</glossterm>. Authorization support takes  the
form of a couple of APIs. The first provides a generic authorization API that
allows callouts to perform access control based on the client's credentials
(i.e. the X.509 certificate chain). The second provides a simple access control
list that maps authorized remote entities to local (system) user names. The
second mechanism also provides callouts that allow third parties to override
the default behavior and is currently used in the Gatekeeper and GridFTP
servers. In addition to the above there are various lower level APIs and tools
for managing, discovering and querying certificates.
