== Configuring GSI ==


--
This section describes the configuration steps required to:

* Configure SSL/TLS security parameters
+
determine whether or not to trust certificates issued by a particular Certificate Authority (CA),

* provide appropriate default values for use by the link:../..gsic/pi/index.html#grid-cert-request[**++grid-cert-request++**] command, which is used to generate certificates,

* request service certificates, used by services to authenticate themselves to users, and

* specify identity mapping information.



In general, Globus tools will look for a configuration file in a
user-specific location first, and in a system-wide location if no
user-specific file was found. The configuration commands described here
may be run by administrators to create system-wide defaults and by
individuals to override those defaults.

=== Configuring Global Security Parameters ===

The configuration file described here was added with the package
globus-gssapi-gsi-11.16 and the toolkit binary package version
6.0.1430141288.

The global security parameters for GSIC are included in the file
++/etc/grid-security/gsi.conf++. This file contains the default values
used by all GSI-enabled servers and clients. The format of the file is a

[[gsic-configuring-trustCA]]
=== Configuring Globus to Trust a Particular Certificate Authority ===


==== Trusted certificates directory ====

The Globus tools will trust certificates issued by a CA if (and only if)
it can find information about the CA in the trusted certificates
directory.

The trusted certificates directory is located as described below and
exists either on a per-machine or on a per-installation basis. 

++X509_CERT_DIR++ is the environment variable used to specify the path
to the trusted certificates directory. This directory contains
information about which CAs are trusted (including the CA certificates
themselves) and, in some cases, configuration information used by
link:../..gsic/pi/index.html#grid-cert-request[**++grid-cert-request++**]
to formulate certificate requests. The location of the trusted
certificates directory is looked for in the following order: 
. value of the ++X509_CERT_DIR++ environment variable

. ++$HOME/.globus/certificates++

. ++/etc/grid-security/certificates++ exists exists

. ++$GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/certificates++




==== Trusted certificates files ====

The following two files must exist in the directory for each trusted CA:



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<table>
        <title>CA files</title>
        <tgroup cols='2'>
          <tbody>
            <row>
              <entry><filename><replaceable>cert_hash</replaceable>.0</filename></entry>
              <entry>The trusted <glossterm>CA Certificate</glossterm>.</entry>
            </row>
            <row>
              <entry><filename><replaceable>cert_hash</replaceable>.signing_policy</filename></entry>
              <entry>A configuration file defining the distinguished names of certificates signed by
                the CA.</entry>
            </row>
          </tbody>
        </tgroup>
      </table>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Non-WS Globus components will honor a certificate only if: 

* its CA certificate exists (with the appropriate name) in the **TRUSTED_CA** directory, and

* the certificate's distinguished name matches the pattern described in the signing policy file.




==== Hash of the CA certificate ====

The **cert_hash** that appears in the file names above is the hash of
the CA certificate, which can be found by running the command:



--------
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/openssl x509 -hash -noout < ca_certificate
--------


==== Creating a signing policy by hand ====

Some CAs provide tools to install their CA certificates and signing
policy files into the trusted certificates directory. You can, however,
create a signing policy file by hand; the signing policy file has the
following format:



--------
access_id_CA X509 'CA Distinguished Name'
pos_rights globus CA:sign
cond_subjects globus '"Distinguished Name Pattern"'
--------

In the above, the **CA Distinguished Name** is the subject name of the
CA certificate, and the **Distinguished Name Pattern** is a string used
to match the distinguished names of certificates granted by the CA. 

Some very simple wildcard matching is done: if the **Distinguished Name
Pattern** ends with a '*', then any distinguished name that matches the
part of the CA subject name before the '*' is considered a match. 

Note: the cond_subjects line may contain a space-separated list of
distinguished name patterns.


==== Repository of CAs ====

A repository of CA certificates that are widely used in academic and
research settings can be found https://www.tacar.org/certs.html[here].


=== Configuring Globus to Create Appropriate Certificate Requests ===

The
link:../..gsic/pi/index.html#grid-cert-request[**++grid-cert-request++**]
command, which is used to create certificates, uses the following
configuration files:



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<table>
      <title>Certificate request configuration files</title>
      <tgroup cols='2'>
        <tbody>
          <row>
            <entry><filename>globus-user-ssl.conf</filename></entry>
            <entry>Defines the distinguished name to use for a user's certificate request. The
              format is described <ulink url='http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/req.html#CONFIGURATION_FILE_FORMAT'>here</ulink>.</entry>
          </row>

            <entry><filename>globus-host-ssl.conf</filename></entry>
            <entry>Defines the distinguished name for a host (or service) certificate request. The
              format is described <ulink url='http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/req.html#CONFIGURATION_FILE_FORMAT'>here</ulink>.</entry>
          </row>
          <row>
            <entry><filename>grid-security.conf</filename></entry>
            <entry>A base configuration file that contains the name and email address for the
            CA.</entry>
          </row>
          <row>
            <entry><filename>directions</filename></entry>
            <entry>An optional file that may contain directions on using the CA.</entry>
          </row>
        </tbody>
      </tgroup>
    </table>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Many CAs provide tools to install configuration files with the following
names in the Trusted Certificates directory:




* ++globus-user-ssl.conf.cert_hash++

* ++globus-host-ssl.conf.cert_hash++

* ++grid_security.conf.cert_hash++

* ++directions.cert_hash++



==== Creating a certificate request for a specific CA ====

The command:



--------
grid-cert-request -ca cert_hash
--------

will create a certificate request based on the specified CA's
configuration files. 


==== Listing available CAs ====

The command:



--------
grid-cert-request -ca
--------

will list the available CAs and let the user choose which one to create
a request for.


==== Specifying a default CA for certificate requests ====

The default CA is the CA that will be used for certificate requests if
link:../..gsic/pi/index.html#grid-cert-request[**++grid-cert-request++**]
is invoked without the '-ca' flag. 

You can specify a default CA by invoking the
link:../..gsic/pi/index.html#grid-default-ca[**++grid-default-ca++**]
command (follow the link for examples of using the command).


==== ++directions++ file file ====

The ++directions++ file may contain specific directions on how to use
the CA. There are three types of printed messages:  file may contain
specific directions on how to use the CA. There are three types of
printed messages: 

* **REQUEST HEADER**, printed to a certificate request file,

* **USER INSTRUCTIONS**, printed on the screen when one requests a user certificate,

* **NONUSER INSTRUCTIONS**, printed on the screen when one requests a certificate for a service.



Each message is delimited from others with lines **----- BEGIN message
type TEXT -----** and **----- END message type TEXT -----**. For
example, the ++directions++ file would contain the following lines: file
would contain the following lines:



--------
----- BEGIN REQUEST HEADER TEXT -----
This is a Certificate Request file

It should be mailed to ${GSI_CA_EMAIL_ADDR}
 ----- END REQUEST HEADER TEXT -----
--------

If this file does not exist, the default messages are printed.


=== Requesting Service Certificates ===

Different CAs use different mechanisms for issuing end-user
certificates; some use mechanisms that are entirely web-based, while
others require you to generate a certificate request and send it to the
CA. If you need to create a certificate request for a service
certificate, you can do so by running:



--------
grid-cert-request -host hostname -service service_name
--------

where **hostname** is the fully-qualified name of the host on which the
service will be running, and **service_name** is the name of the
service. This will create the following three files:



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<table>
      <title>Certificate request files</title>
      <tgroup cols='2'>
        <tbody>
          <row>
            <entry><filename><replaceable>GRID_SECURITY/service_name/service_name</replaceable>cert.pem</filename></entry>
            <entry>An empty file. When you receive your actual service certificate from your CA, you
              should place it in this file.</entry>

          <row>
            <entry><filename><replaceable>GRID_SECURITY/service_name/service_name</replaceable>cert_request.pem</filename></entry>

            <entry>The <glossterm>private key</glossterm> associated with your certificate request,
              encrypted with the pass phrase that you entered when prompted by <command>grid-cert-request</command>.</entry>
          </row>
        </tbody>
      </tgroup>
    </table>

The
link:../..gsic/pi/index.html#grid-cert-request[**++grid-cert-request++**]
command recognizes several other useful options; you can list these
with:

[[setting-up-gridmap]]
=== Configuring Credential Mappings ===

Several Globus services map certificates to local unix usernames to be
used with unix services. The default implementation uses a gridmap file
to map the distinguished name of the identity of the client's
certificate to a local login name. Administrators can modify the
contents of the gridmap file to control what certificate identities are
allowed to access Globus services, as well as configure, via an
environment variable, what gridmap file a particular service uses. 

In addition to the identity-based mapping done via the gridmap file,
administrators can configure Globus services to to use arbitrary mapping
functions. These may use other criteria, such as SAML assertions, to map
a certificate to a local account, or may map certificates to temporary
accounts. Administrators can install different mapping implementations
and configure services to use them by creating appropriate configuration
files and setting environment variables. 


==== Configuring Identity Mappings Using ++gridmap++ Files Files ====

Gridmap files contain a database of entries mapping distinguished names
to local user names. These may be manipulated by using the following
tools. 


===== Adding an entry to a gridmap file =====

To add an entry to the gridmap file, run:



--------
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/grid-mapfile-add-entry \
        -dn "Distinguished Name" \
        -ln local_name
--------


===== Deleting an entry from a gridmap file =====

To delete an entry from the gridmap file, run:



--------
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/grid-mapfile-delete-entry \
        -dn "Distinguished Name" \
        -ln local_name
--------


===== Checking consistency of a gridmap file =====

To check the consistency of the gridmap file, run



--------
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/grid-mapfile-check-consistency
--------


===== Configuring per-service gridmap files =====

To configure a service to use a particular gridmap file, set the
++GRIDMAP++ variable in the service's environment to the path of the
gridmap file. In this way, you can grant different access rights to
different certificate identities on a per-service basis by setting the
++GRIDMAP++ variable in different service environments. 

You can use tools described above to operate on different gridmap files
by either setting the ++GRIDMAP++ environment variable prior to invoking
them, or by using the '-mapfile' command-line option. 

For reference, the GSI C code looks for the gridmap in these locations:

===== Gridmap formats =====

A gridmap line of the form:



--------
"Distinguished Name" local_name
--------

maps the distinguished name 'Distinguished Name' to the local name
'local_name'. 

A gridmap line of the form:



--------
"Distinguished Name" local_name1,local_name2
--------

maps 'Distinguished Name' to both 'local_name1' and 'local_name2'; any
number of local user names may occur in the comma-separated local name
list.

==== Configuring Alternate Credential Mappings ====

To use an alternative credential mapping, you create a
++gsi-authz.conf++ file containing information about how the mapping
functions are called from the authorization library.  file containing
information about how the mapping functions are called from the
authorization library. 

To configure a per-service authorization configuration file, set the
++GSI_AUTHZ_CONF++ variable to the path to the configuration file in the
