            <simpara>During host authorization, the toolkit treats host names of the form
                    &quot;hostname-<replaceable>ANYTHING</replaceable>.edu&quot; as equivalent to
                &quot;hostname.edu&quot;. This means that if a service was set up to do host
                authorization and hence accept the certificate &quot;hostname.edu&quot;, it would
                also accept certificates with DNs
                &quot;hostname-<replaceable>ANYTHING</replaceable>.edu&quot;. </simpara>
            <simpara> The feature is in place to allow a multi-homed host following a
                &quot;hostname-interface&quot; naming convention, to have a single host certificate.
                For example, host &quot;grid.test.edu&quot; would also accept the likes of
                &quot;grid-1.test.edu&quot; or &quot;grid-foo.test.edu&quot;. </simpara>
            <note>
                <simpara>The string <replaceable>ANYTHING</replaceable> matches only the name of the
                    host and not domain components. This means that &quot;hostname.edu&quot; will
                    not match &quot;hostname-foo.sub.edu&quot;, but will match
                    &quot;host-foo.edu&quot;.</simpara>
            </note>
            <note>
                <simpara>If a host was set up to accept &quot;hostname-1.edu&quot;, it will not
                    accept &quot;hostname-<replaceable>ANYTHING</replaceable>.edu&quot; but will
                    accept &quot;hostname.edu&quot;. That is, only one of the names being compared
                    may contain the hyphen character in the host name.</simpara>
            </note>
            <simpara>A <ulink url="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2969"
                    >bug</ulink> has been opened to see if this feature needs to be modified. </simpara>
            <simpara>In GT <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable>, it is possible to
                disable this behavior, by setting the enviornment variable
                    <envar>GLOBUS_GSSAPI_NAME_COMPATIBILITY</envar> to <literal
                    >STRICT_RFC2818</literal>. </simpara>
