  <entry>Your proxy credential may have expired.</entry>
  <entry>
Use <olink targetdoc='gsicPI' targetptr='grid-proxy-info'>grid-proxy-info</olink> to check whether the proxy credential has actually expired. 
   If it has, generate a new proxy with <olink targetdoc='gsicPI' targetptr='grid-proxy-init'>grid-proxy-init</olink>.

  <entry><code>The system clock on either the local or remote system is wrong.</code></entry>
  <entry>This may cause the server or client to conclude that a credential has expired.</entry>
  <entry>
Check the system clocks on the local and remote system.

  <entry>Your end-user certificate may have expired</entry>
  <entry>
Use <olink targetdoc='gsicPI' targetptr='grid-cert-info'>grid-cert-info</olink> to check your certificate's expiration date. 
   If it has expired, follow your CA's procedures to get a new one.

  <entry><code>The permissions may be wrong on your proxy file</code></entry>
  <entry>If the permissions on your proxy file are too lax (for example, if others can read your proxy file), Globus Toolkit clients will not use that 
   file to authenticate. </entry>
  <entry>
You can "fix" this problem by changing the permissions on the file or by destroying it (with 
   <olink targetdoc='gsicPI' targetptr='grid-proxy-destroy'>grid-proxy-destroy</olink>) and creating a new one (with 
   <olink targetdoc='gsicPI' targetptr='grid-proxy-init'>grid-proxy-init</olink>). 
   <simpara><emphasis role='strong'>Important:</emphasis> However, it is still possible that someone else has made a copy of that file during the time that the permissions were 
    wrong. In that case, they will be able to impersonate you until the proxy file expires or your permissions or end-user certificate are revoked, 
    whichever happens first.</simpara>

  <row>
  <entry><code>The permissions may be wrong on your private key file</code></entry>
  <entry>If the permissions on your end user certificate private key file are too lax (for example, if others can read the file), grid-proxy-init will refuse to create a proxy certificate. </entry>
  <entry>
You can "fix" this by changing the permissions on the private key file. 

<simpara><emphasis role='strong'>Important:</emphasis> However, you will still have a much more serious problem: 
it's possible that someone has made a copy of your private key file. Although this file is encrypted, it is possible that someone will 
be able to decrypt the private key, at which point they will be able to impersonate you as long as your end user certificate is valid. 
You should contact your CA to have your end-user certificate revoked and get a new one.</simpara>

  <entry>The remote system may not trust your CA</entry>

Verify that the remote system is configured to trust the CA that issued your end-entity certificate. See <olink targetdoc='gtadmin'></olink> for details.

  <entry><code>You may not trust the remote system's CA</code></entry>
  <entry>You may not trust the remote system's CA</entry>
  <entry>
Verify that your system is configured to trust the remote CA (or that your environment is set up to trust the remote CA). See 
   <olink targetdoc='gtadmin'></olink> for details.

  <entry>There may be something wrong with the remote service's credentials</entry>
  <entry>
It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between errors reported by the remote service regarding your credentials and errors reported by the 
client interface regarding the remote service's credentials. If you can't find anything wrong with your credentials, check for the same conditions 
on the remote system (or ask a remote administrator to do so) .
