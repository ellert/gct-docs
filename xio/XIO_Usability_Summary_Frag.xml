<para>The API for GlobusXIO has not changed to any significant degree 
    since its introduction.  All other usability issues relate to

    therefore subject to the usability of the installation tools found
    at the <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/downloads/">Toolkit Downloads</ulink> page.</para>
