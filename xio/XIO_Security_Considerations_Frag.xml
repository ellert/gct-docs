<section id="xio-security-considerations"><title>Security considerations for XIO</title>
<para>Globus XIO is a framework for creating network protocols.  Several
      existing protocols, such as TCP, come built into the framework.  XIO
      itself introduces no known security risks. However, all network
      applications expose systems to the risks inherent when outsiders can connect to them.  Also included in the XIO distribution is the GSI
      driver, which provides a driver that allows for secure connections.
