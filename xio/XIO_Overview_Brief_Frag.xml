<para> Globus XIO is an extensible input/output 
library written in C for the Globus Toolkit. It provides a single API 
(open/close/read/write) that supports multiple wire protocols, with protocol
 implementations encapsulated as drivers. The XIO drivers distributed with
  <replaceable role="entity">version</replaceable> include TCP, UDP, file, HTTP, GSI, GSSAPI_FTP, TELNET and queuing. 
 In addition, Globus XIO provides a driver development interface for use by
  protocol developers. This interface allows the developer to concentrate on
  writing protocol code rather than infrastructure, as XIO provides a framework
  for error handling, asynchronous message delivery, timeouts, etc.
 The XIO driver-based approach maximizes the reuse of code by supporting the
  notion of a driver stack. XIO drivers can be written as atomic units and stacked
  on top of one another. This modularization provides maximum flexibility and
  simplifies the design and evaluation of individual protocols. <!-- point to clusterworld article? http://www.globus.org/alliance/publications/clusterworld/0404GridFinal.pdf  --></para>
