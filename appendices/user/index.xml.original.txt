You can download the link:gtUserGuide.pdf[PDF version here]. This page
contains information for commonly performed tasks using GT components.
This assumes a default installation and covers the more basic tasks
using common tools. Due to size, all GT command line clients are listed
link:[here].
 
Note that GT itself is typically used as middleware and not necessarily
intended to be used directly by end-users. Instead, grid developers tend
to use GT to develop higher-level services and systems that are then
used by end-users (where GT is essentially the plumbing). However, GT
Release Manuals include User's Guides for each established component
that describe how the public interfaces are intended to be used -
whether it is by a human or a program.

[[gtuser-environment]]
== Setting up your environment ==

--

This step is usually a prerequisite for using GT commands. Make sure you
have set GLOBUS_LOCATION to the location of your Toolkit installation.
There are two environment scripts called
++$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh++ and  and
++$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.csh++. You should read in
whichever one corresponds to the type of shell you are using.. You
should read in whichever one corresponds to the type of shell you are
using.


For example, in csh or tcsh, you would run: 
--------
source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.csh
--------



In sh, bash, ksh, or zsh, you would run: 
--------
. $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh
--------



Set Globus location: 
--------
$ export GLOBUS_LOCATION='/opt/globus/apps/globus-version'
--------



Source it.. 
--------
source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh
               source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-devel-env.sh
--------

[[gtuser-security]]
== Security ==

--

This chapter provides information about basic security tasks in GT 6.0.


--

=== Obtaining certificates ===

Security is at the heart of Globus, and unless you are running without
security (only recommended for testing), you will not be able to use
most of Globus unless you have obtained a certificate for yourself.
(Note that you may use GridFTP without certificates if you are only
using ++ftp://++ or  or ++http://++ protocols.) protocols.)


For basic information about obtaining certificates, see
link:../../admin/install/index.html#gtadmin-basic-host[] in the
Installation Guide.


[IMPORTANT]
--

Remember to keep track of when your certificates expire. If your
certificates expire, you may not be able to use your services until they
are refreshed.

=== Authenticating (who are you?) ===

[[gtuser-generate-proxy]]
==== Generate a valid proxy certificate ====

Before using many of the tools in GT, a user must generate a valid user
proxy. Use
link:../..gsic/user/index.html#grid-proxy-init[grid-proxy-init]. The
following is an example:




--------
% $GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/grid-proxy-init
Your identity: /O=Grid/OU=GlobusTest/OU=simpleCA.mymachine/OU=mymachine/CN=John Doe
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
Creating proxy ................................. Done
Your proxy is valid until: Tue Oct 26 01:33:42 2004
--------


=== Authorizing (what are you allowed to do?) ===

Basic authorization in GT is enforced via a grid map file, a file that
contains mappings of certificate subject names to local user names, like
the following:




--------
 "/O=Grid/O=Globus/OU=your.domain.edu/CN=Your Name"    youruser
--------
