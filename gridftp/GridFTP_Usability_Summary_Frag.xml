<section><title>Usability Summary</title>
<para>The following areas have received substantial effort in order to make using GridFTP easier, 
    more enjoyable, etc:</para>
<itemizedlist>
    <listitem><simpara>100% protocol compatibility with previous versions.  Any <glossterm>client</glossterm>/<glossterm>server</glossterm> combination since 2.4.0 
			should work (barring a new client trying to invoke new functionality on an old server).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem><simpara>Greatly improved documentation.  It is not complete, and we will continue to develop it, but it is far 
		better than past versions.</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><para>
For GT 4.0.0 there is a completely new server implementation that provides the following benefits:
<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><simpara>More stable (one project went from on the order of 1000 failures in a large workflow with the 2.4.3 server to zero failures with the new server).</simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara>More scalable (we had a single server supporting 1800 clients).</simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara>Easier to extend and modify. The Data Storage Interface (DSI) allows a clean way to access things other than POSIX file systems, such as tape systems, custom storage systems, etc.</simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara>Ability to run threaded servers (previous versions of the server did not support this).</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara><glossterm>striping</glossterm> is now available (allows multi-Gigabit speeds).</simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara>Easier server configuration.</simpara></listitem>
