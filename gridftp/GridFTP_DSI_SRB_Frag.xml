    <para>Working with the SRB team at the San Diego Supercomputing Center, we have written a Data
        Storage Interface (DSI) for read/write access to data in the Storage Resource Broker (SRB)
        (http://www.npaci.edu/DICE/SRB). This DSI will enable GridFTP compliant clients to read and
        write data to an SRB server, similar in functionality to the sput/sget commands.</para>
    <para> This DSI is currently in testing and is not yet publicly available, but will be available
        from both the SRB web site (here) and the Globus web site (here). It will also be included
        in the next stable release of the toolkit. We are working on performance tests, but early
        results indicate that for wide area network (WAN) transfers, the performance is comparable. </para>

    <para>When might you want to use this functionality:</para>

        <listitem>
            <simpara>You have existing tools that use GridFTP clients and you want to access data
                that is in SRB</simpara>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <simpara>You have distributed data sets that have some of the data in SRB and some of
                the data available from GridFTP servers. </simpara>
