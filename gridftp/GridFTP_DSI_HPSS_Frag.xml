  <para>Last Update: August 2005</para>

  <para>Working with Los Alamos National Laboratory and the High Performance Storage System (HPSS)
    collaboration (<ulink url="http://www.hpss-collaboration.org"
    >http://www.hpss-collaboration.org</ulink>), we have written a Data Storage Interface (DSI) for
    read/write access to HPSS. This DSI would allow an existing application that uses a GridFTP
    compliant client to utilize an HPSS data resources.</para>

  <para>This DSI is currently in testing. Due to changes in the HPSS security mechanisms, it
    requires HPSS 6.2 or later, which is due to be released in Q4 2005. Distribution for the DSI has
    not been worked out yet, but it will *probably* be available from both Globus and the HPSS
    collaboration. While this code will be open source, it requires underlying HPSS libraries which
    are NOT open source (proprietary). </para>

  <note>
    <simpara>This is a purely server side change, the client does not know what DSI is running, so
      only a site that is already running HPSS and wants to allow GridFTP access needs to worry
      about access to these proprietary libraries. </simpara>
