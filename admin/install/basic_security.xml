	<section id="gt-admin-firewall">
		<title>Firewall configuration</title>
		<para> There are four possible firewall scenarios that might present themselves:
			restrictions on incoming and outgoing ports for both client and server scenarios.</para>
		<para>This section divides sites into two categories: client sites, which have users that
			are acting as clients to Grid services, and server sites, which are running Grid
			services. Server sites also often act as client sites either because they also have
			users on site or jobs submitted by users to the site act as clients to other sites by
			retrieving data from other sites or spawning sub-jobs.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Client Site Firewall Requirements</title>
			<para>This section describes the requirements placed on firewalls at sites containing
				Globus Toolkit clients. Note that often jobs submitted to sites running Globus
				services will act as clients (e.g. retrieving files needed by the job, spawning
				subjobs), so server sites will also have client site requirements.</para>
			<section>
				<title>Allowed Outgoing Ports</title>
				<para>Clients need to be able to make outgoing connections freely from ephemeral
					ports on hosts at the client site to all ports at server sites.</para>
			</section>
			<section id="gtadmin-client-incomingports">
				<title>Allowed Incoming Ports</title>
				<para>As described in <olink targetdoc="gram5Developer"
						targetptr="gram5-developer-jobstatecallbacks"/>, the Globus Toolkit GRAM
					service uses callbacks to communicate state changes to clients and, optionally,
					to stage files to/from the client. If connections are not allowed back to the
					Globus Toolkit clients, the following restrictions will be in effect: </para>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<simpara>You cannot do a job submission request and redirect the output back
							to the client. This means the globus-job-run command won't work.
							globus-job-submit will work, but you cannot use globus-job-get-output.
							globusrun with the -o option also will not work.</simpara>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<simpara>Staging to or from the client will also not work, which precludes
							the -s and -w options.</simpara>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<simpara>The client cannot be notified of state changes in the job, e.g.
							completion.</simpara>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				<para>To allow these callbacks, client sites should allow incoming connection in the
					ephemeral port range. Client sites wishing to restrict incoming connections in
					the ephemeral port range should select a port range for their site. The size of
					this range should be approximately 10 ports per expected simultaneous user on a
					given host, though this may vary depending on the actual usage characteristics.
					Hosts on which clients run should have the GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE environment
					variable set for the users to reflect the site’s chosen range.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Network Address Translation (NAT)</title>
				<para>Clients behind NATs will be restricted as described in <olink
						targetptr="gtadmin-client-incomingports"/> unless the firewall and site
					hosts are configured to allow incoming connections.</para>
				<para>This configuration involves: <itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
							<simpara>Select a separate portion of the ephemeral port range for each
								host at the site on which clients will be running (e.g. 45000-45099
								for host A, 45100-45199 for host B, etc.).</simpara>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<simpara>Configure the NAT to direct incoming connections in the port
								range for each host back to the appropriate host (e.g., configure
								45000-45099 on the NAT to forward to 45000-45099 on host
								A).</simpara>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<simpara>Configure the Globus Toolkit clients on each site host to use
								the selected port range for the host using the techniques described
								in <olink targetdoc="gridftpUser"
									targetptr="gridftp-user-config-client-firewall"/>.</simpara>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<simpara>Configure Globus Toolkit clients to advertise the firewall as
								the hostname to use for callbacks from the server host. This is done
								using the GLOBUS_HOSTNAME environment variable. The client must also
								have the GLOBUS_HOSTNAME environment variable set to the hostname of
								the external side of the NAT firewall. This will cause the client
								software to advertise the firewall's hostname as the hostname to be
								used for callbacks causing connections from the server intended for
								it to go to the firewall (which redirects them to the
								client).</simpara>
						</listitem>
					</itemizedlist></para>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section>
			<title>Server Site Firewall Requirements</title>
			<para>This section describes firewall policy requirements at sites that host Grid
				services. Sites that host Grid services often host Grid clients, however the policy
				requirements described in this section are adequate for clients as well.</para>
			<section>
				<title>Allowed Incoming Ports</title>
				<para>A server site should allow incoming connections to the well-known Grid Service
					Ports as well as ephemeral ports. These ports are 22/tcp (for gsi-enabled
					openssh), 2119/tcp (for GRAM) and 2811/tcp for GridFTP.</para>
				<para>A server not allowing incoming connections in the ephemeral port range will
					have the following restrictions: <itemizedlist>
						<listitem>
							<simpara>If port 2119/tcp is open, GRAM will allow jobs to be submitted,
								but further management of the jobs will not be possible.</simpara>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<simpara>While it will be possible to make GridFTP control connections
								if port 2811/tcp is open, it will not possible to actually get or
								put files.</simpara>
						</listitem>
					</itemizedlist></para>
				<para>Server sites wishing to restrict incoming connections in the ephemeral port
					range should select a range of port numbers. The size of this range should be
					approximately 20 ports per expected simultaneous user on a given host, though
					this may vary depending on the actual usage characteristics. While it will take
					some operational experience to determine just how big this range needs to be, it
					is suggested that any major server site open a port range of at least a few
					hundred ports. Grid Services should configured as described in Section to
					reflect the site’s chosen range.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Allowed Outgoing Ports</title>
				<para>Server sites should allow outgoing connections freely from ephemeral ports at
					the server site to ephemeral ports at client sites as well as to Grid Service
					Ports at other sites.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title> Network Address Translation (NAT)</title>
				<para>Grid services are not supported to work behind NAT firewalls because the
					security mechanisms employed by Globus require knowledge of the actual IP
					address of the host that is being connected to.</para>
				<para>We do note there have been some successes in running GT services behind NAT
					firewalls.</para>

			<title>Controlling The Ephemeral Port Range</title>
			<para>Controllable ephemeral ports in the Globus Toolkit can be restricted to a given
				range. setting the environment variable GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE can restrict ephemeral
				ports. The value of this variable should be formatted as min,max (a comma separated
				pair). This will cause the GT libraries (specifically GlobusIO) to select port
				numbers for controllable ports in that specified range.
				<screen>% GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=40000,40010

				This environment variable is respected by both clients and servers that are started
				from within the environment in which it is set. There are better ways, however, to
				configure a globus-job-manager or a GridFTP server to restrict its port range. <itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<simpara>globus-job-manager has an option, -globus-tcp-port-range PORT_RANGE
							that acts in the same manner as the environment variable. It can be
							specified on the command line or in the configuration file. See the <olink
