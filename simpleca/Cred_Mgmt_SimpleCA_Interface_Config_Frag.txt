=== Configure SimpleCA for multiple machines ===

So far, you have a single machine configured with SimpleCA certificates.
Recall that in
link:../../simpleca/admin/index.html#simpleca-confirmcert[] a CA setup
package was created in
++.globus/simpleCA/globus_simple_ca_HASH_setup-0.17.tar.gz++. If you
want to use your certificates on another machine, you must install that
CA setup package on that machine. . If you want to use your certificates
on another machine, you must install that CA setup package on that
machine. 

To install it, copy that package to the second machine and run: 

--------
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-build globus_simple_ca_HASH_setup-0.17.tar.gz gcc32dbg
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-postinstall
--------


Then you will have to perform **++setup-gsi -default++** from
link:../../simpleca/admin/index.html#simpleca-finalizing[]. 

If you are going to run services on the second host, it will need its
own host certificate
(link:../../simpleca/admin/index.html#simpleca-hostcert[]) and
grid-mapfile (as described in the basic configuration instructions in
link:../../admin/install/index.html#gtadmin-basic-gridmap[]). 

You may re-use your user certificates on the new host. You will need to
copy the requests to the host where the SimpleCA was first installed in
order to sign them.
